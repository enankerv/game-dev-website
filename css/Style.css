        Stylesheet Guide
        ------------------------------------------------------

        This Stylesheet is broken up by sections:
            
            Fonts: Containing imports for various font styles and font faces used for the website 
            Element Stylings: CSS stylings of elements within the pages
            Class Stylings: CSS stylings for various classes used within the pages

        Each of these sections is indicated by a comment at the start of it and the sections are presented in the order above from top to bottom.

        Each section individually is sorted in alphabetical order.

        FONT RATIONAL:

        I decided to go with Montserrat, a serif font, and Libre Baskerville, a sans-serif font. I wanted most of my information to be easy to read and digest,
        in class we learned that sans-serif fonts are the easiest on the eye when it comes to digital media thus I wanted that to be the font of choice for the majority
        of the pages I wrote. I liked Montserrat in particular because of how clean and simple the font looks on a page. I Paired it with Libre Baskerville because
        I wanted to do a classic serif/sans-serif font combination. The two contrast eachother wonderfully as the serif font headers and nav bar display a level of confidence in them.
        I wanted my headings to be strong but not messy, so I didnt want a script or decorative font. The confident serif tries to give the site user the impression that
        they can trust the information that I am putting out there. Pairing the two together worked wonders as the difference from headings to body text is really stark and
        helps the reader to scan the page as they can tell exactly where headings are and the body text that accompanies it.

        COLOR RATIONALE:

        I chose to keep the main white and black colors for the page. I liked how clean and spaced out everything looked with the white background and wanted to
        introduce some contrast with black. It gives the page a clean simple look which was the idea for the website (a simple way to learn how to develop video games).
        I chose some blue accents after a long while researching what 'techie' colors looked like. I found that cooler tones and blues especially are the most popular colors
        chosen by tech companies and as such are associated with tech. I wanted a lighter blue specifically because I wanted the cool and calm feelings of blue instead
        of the sadness instilled by incredibly deep blue colors. It also served as a good contrast to some of the darker text that I laid ontop of it. 

        COLOR PROCESS:

        For the Index I wanted to make the header POP so I contrasted the black with the blue background. I also wanted to make the links pop but wanted them to be
        different from the other headers so I made them a lighter blue to lead the eye down the page and end there last.
        For the getting started page I did not want to overload it by making the filled sections blue as I felt that keeping blue for highlighting important 
        information was what I wanted to do with the color, so I simply chose a light grey to help divide the page into horizontal sections against the white 
        background and also let the black text and blue headers shine through it. The Game Engine page was fun to make, I used the color trick from the Index page with
        the contrasting black on blue background but then I made the concious decision to have the pro/con chart headers the blue color too and keep their bodies black
        in order to create further contrast within the list. If I made the list items blue too the eye would've gotten lost in all of it, further the GoDot logo was
        also blue too so in my opinion there would have been too much blue for the highlights that I was going for.
