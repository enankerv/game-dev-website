                        <h2>An Overview of Game Design and Who I Am:</h2>
                        <p> Hi welcome to my website! This site should serve as a jumping off point for your game development research. Whether you are a hobbiest or an aspiring professional
                            everyone has to start somewhere. I am Ethan Nankervis and I began getting into game design in the summer of 2020, I begun much the same as you and was quickly overwhelmed
                            by just how much you can do within game design, it put me off of developing for a while. Eventually I had managed to scrounge up enough knowledge through obscure forums and
                            youtubers to be able to make my own game. I have made this website in the hopes that you will not need to go through the hassel that I endured to start learning how to 
                            make games. This site should serve as an all inclusive way to get a background on game development.

                    <h3><a href="getting-started.html">Interested in getting started?</a></h3>
                    <p>Game design may seem like a ginormous task, so I have worked to collect some information to help you get on your way with info about
                        game engines, genres, and some advanced tips for you to think about before you start development
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><a>Learn about Game Jams</a></h3>
                    <p>Game Jams are events hosted by people and companies where you have a limited amount of time to create a game following a 
                        given theme.</p>

                    <h3><a>Helpful Youtubers</a></h3>
                    <p>While this website is a great jumping off point there are plenty of people who you can learn and draw inspiration from to hone your craft</p>
