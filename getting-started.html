                    <h2><a>Game Genres</a></h2>
                    <p>Once you know what engine you're going to use for your game it can be helpful to understand what genres of games there are. Genre's act as a blanket
                        theme or playstyle for your game. It helps give developers some direction in programing a game by having common tropes within games that apply
                        to that genre specifically, and helps players know if your game is something they'd be interested in based off of genres they like.
